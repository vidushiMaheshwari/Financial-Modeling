# Financial-Modeling
Welcome to the Financial Modeling repository! This repository contains various financial models that simulate and analyze different aspects of financial markets. The models currently included cover topics such as Brownian motion, Modern Portfolio Theory, and Binomial Option Pricing methods.
Feel free to explore the repository and utilize these models for your financial analysis and research purposes.

## Models
All the models are present under the notebooks folder. <br> <br>
The market data is taken from yahoo finance and manually kept in the data folder. This is done to prevent any inconsistencies in results and removing the dependency from any API for longetivity. <br> <br>
